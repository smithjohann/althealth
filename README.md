AltHealth is a web-based application which provides a graphical user interface (GUI) to manage a databased based on the small business operations; such as processing and storing client (i.e. patients and/or consumers) information, supplement and supplier information, appointments and bookings, as well as statistics in the form of management information system (MIS) reports for the owner of the business.

In order to access the system, kindly unzip the AltHealth.zip folder which will produce all the data files of the system in the htdocs folder. 
Alternatively, you may deploy the htodcs folder by replacing your current htdocs folder (should you make use of XAMPP). 

Kindly note that this system is developed and tested with XAMPP version 7.1.8 x86 due to client specifications at the time of development. 

//IMPORTANT NOTE//
Due to an email change and a permissions issue from Google, I have temporarily suspended the email functionality on the application. 

Kindly refer to the User Manual for guidance on making use of the system. 
The Installation and Administration Manual will assist in installing all relevant applications, as well as the necessary additions required to make use of the system's full functionality. 
The Evaluation and Preparation guide contains the usernames and passwords in Appendix B which is imperative for the application. 
The Database Guide contains an overview and explanation on the database structure of the application. 

Should you have any queries with regards to my system, please do not hesitate to reach out to me. 

Thank you for your support :)
